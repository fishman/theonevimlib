2. Why and what is TOVL					*tovl-why*  {{{1
   
  TOVL tries to be
  - a configuration system for plugins
  - a high quality code base which everyone can depend uppon maximizing code sharing
  - open: everyone should be able to contribute his code and ideas

  People are reimplementing the same stuff over and over again.
  Maybe we can mimimize this using an open library.
  There is still very much which can be done.

  There is already vim.org and page http://xy, what is different?
  Noone of those script collections really solves one problem:
    How to update scripts while preseving your modified mappings ?
  How does TOVL solve this?
  TOVL separates the configuration of a "plugin" from the implementation.
  See |tovl-config|. It also tries to do the download and collection work for
  you. The downside is that you'll have a lot of files laying around which you
  won't use ever. However using |autoload-functions| this shoud be cheap and
  only waste some disk space.

  Q: Do we really need TOVL?
  R: Yes, people are already using emacs because some things do just work.
  (You can make them work in vim as well.. But you have to spend much more
  time on it..)

==============================================================================

3. installation / updating TOVL / How to contribute / contact *tovl-update* {{{1

  TOVL development is tracked by git. git is a decentralised version control
  system.

  To get TOVL there are two ways:
    a) use an packed archive (.zip, .tar.gz)
        http://github.com/MarcWeber/theonevimlib (-> download button)
    b) use git (recommended) >
        git clone git://github.com/MarcWeber/theonevimlib.git
        git pull # this updates the repository
<      you'll get the whole development history as well.

  To install TOVL simply add this to your .vimrc >
    set runtimepath+=<pathtotovl>/core
    " set |tovl-global-config| options
    call theonevimlibsetup#Setup()
< Then run :helptags Path_TO_DEST/core/doc

  basic setup (mandatory!):
  1) Starting Vim
     You will need to start your vim session with >
       vim --servername VIM
<    if you do not use gvim or the likes.

  2) Run command >
     TOVLConfig
<    You'll be asked wether you want to activate a bunch of recommended
     plugins. Say y here. If you want to use <m-*> or <m-s-*> mappings
     in console you should deactivate the PluginMap and activate
     PluginMapEscHack instead (see |tovl-shell-esc-hack|)

  4) Now write the buffer to make the changes permanent. >
     :w

< Continue either with
  a) |tovl-config-tutorial|
  b)  some of the *.txt files found in this doc directory as well
      Not everything is worth putting into a tovl plugin. However many
      things are worth writing down. This can be extended to a nice
      (maintained) tip collection..
      |ft_xml.txt|
  
  (if you don't read this within the vim help browser goto the end of
  core/doc/tovl-config-buffer.txt)

  *tovl-contribute*
  You can contribute in various ways:
    a) tell me what you (dis)like
    b) send (git) patches or tell me to pull from somewhere

  My first idea was to allow everyone to push to the git repository.
  However some people (including Bram) argued that this might be a security
  risk. Anyway you have to trust me ;-)

----------------------
  *tovl-contact*
  contact: (add your address as well if you like)
  MarcWeber on irc.freenode.org or mail: marco-oweber@gmx.de

  If this project takes of we'll either move discussion to vim-users (if there
  is low traffic only) or create a new mailinglist..
==============================================================================
4.  TOVL and plugin configuration                          *tovl-config* {{{1

GLOBAL CONFIG                                   *tovl-global-config*

  Ideally this should be done by a plugin as well.
  (-> |tovl-wish-list|). 
  However you can set these options in your .vimrc
  * |config#filesFunc|
  * |config#DotVim| Which is your default ~/.vim directory defaulting to
                    split(&runtimepath,',')[0]
  * |tovl-log-config|
  * |tovl-shell-esc-hack|
  * |tovl-config-dont-add-defaults|
  * vim setting (additional to tovl#runtaskinbackground#Vim()) (TODO)

TOVL SHELL ESC HACK				*tovl-shell-esc-hack*
  Most shells don't support <m-*> mappings because the Meta key is sent as
  Esc. By activating |PluginMapEscHack| instead of |PluginMap|
   <m-a> will be replaced by <esc>a and <m-s-a> by <esc>A. The additional
   commands Nnoremap Noremap Inoremap Vnoreamp will be defined.
  which is what the terminal vim is most likely to receive. However don't
  blame me if strange things start happening because multiple key combinations
  will be mapped to the same codes.. I'm happy with this setup.
  Using something like this for x in [all characters] >
  set <m-x>=^[x
< could do this as well ?

STRUCTURE                                       *tovl-config-bar* {{{2

    The TOVL configuration is basically a huge dictionary. Vim can serialize
    this easily (string, eval). So I think this is fastest when reading.
    You should use config#Get() and config#Set() to access options.

    However the output of string(<some dict>) is hard to read. That's why
    TOVL has an implementation to serialize arbitrary vim types to human
    readable text using python like indentation. (config#ToBuffer,
    config#FromBuffer)

    However you don't have to call them yourself, see EDITING below
    Also see |config#GetByPath()| |config#GetG()|

MULTIPLE PROJECT SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION FILES  *tovl-project-specific* {{{2

    TOVL supports multiple configuration files. Use >

    *config#filesFunc*
	call config#SetG('config#filesFunc',
	  \ library#Function("return [expand('$HOME').'/.theonevimlib_config']")
<
    in your .vimrc to define a different list. Be careful that only you have
    access to them because someone else might add malicious code.
    (TODO check file premisions)

CONFIG CACHE					*tovl-config-cache* {{{2

    TOVL doesn't reread the configuration files from disk automatically
    if the timestamp is newer. Also the configuration file is written
    automatically if you set a value. TOVL tries to minimize the chance that
    one vim instance overrides the configuration written by another instance.
    The function doing all the dirty work for you is |config#ScanIfNewer|.
    You can use it in your own scripts. (I've done so to provide vimscript
    function completion).

MERGING CONFIGURATION				*tovl-config-merge* {{{2

    Imagine a plugin inserting templates. To configure it you have to tell
    it about a list of directories containing those.
    Now you work on a project and you'd like to use your own plugins and
    project specific ones. One solution is to have a
    plugin#template_sources directory list in you personal config and in the
    configuration file of the project directory. Now you can specify a merge
    function which concatenates both lists (see config.vim) However its very
    likely that this changes. I'd like to define the merge functions within
    the config as well (TODO)

EDITING THE CONFIGURATION AND LOADING PLUGINS      *tovl-config-edit* {{{2
    See |tovl-config-buffer.txt|

==============================================================================
5.   TOVL design notes				*tovl-design-nodes* {{{1

  If you implement a feature try to do it in a way that it can be reused.
  Example: multiple_completions.vim keeps a list for each buffer.
  You can pick a completion to be used.
  This is much better than assigning completefunc yourself because users might
  want to use different plugins at the same time. Eg in PHP it does make sense
  to have SQL and PHP and maybe even HTML or Javascript completion
  functions..

  I had in mind to never break things by using >
    file#v1#Func()
< then change that to  >
    file#v1#Func()
< if the interface changes

  However this will lead to many different files doing the same thing which is
  even more evil than breaking things once to make things better.
  The biggest problem about changing interfaces is that all depending code has
  to be changed as well. This can be done in one reposiotry. But this is much
  harder (I'd even say impossible) when using a distribution system such as
  scripts on www.vim.org.

  Another example is tovl/ui/open_thing_at_cursor.vim or |library#Try()|

  If you don't know yet what arguments a function will require consider using
  a dictionary as optional arg. Then use something like this: >
    fun X(...)
      let opts = a:0 > 0 ? a:1 : <+default+>
      if get(opts, 'key', default)
      endif
    endfun
<
  What else to put here?

==============================================================================
6.   TOVL feature sets:					*tovl-feature-sets* {1

  Vim has: filetypes. To add html features to a php file you typically do
  runtime ftplugin/php*.vim. However this typically also overrides your
  completion func.. :-(

  So there should be a way to only add some of the html mappings when editing
  php files? That what TOVL feature sets are about:

  You have features (mappings, commands, completion functions). You give this
  set of features a name which I call a tag. For example your tag could be
  ReplaceSpecialChars

  Then you can use   *BufferFeatureTags*  >
    BufferFeatureTags ReplaceSpecialChars
< to add those commands and >
    BufferFeatureTags -ReplaceSpecialChars
< to remove them again. You can add more than one tag at the same time: >
    BufferFeatureTags -ReplaceSpecialChars Foo -Bar

< Get the current status by ivoking the command without arguments: >
    BufferFeatureTags
<
  So what about global mappings such as version control commands or Grep?
  There is the command *GlobalFeatureTags* for those.

  Note! you have to enable the plugin |PluginFeatureSet| to get those
  commands.

  You can extend the supported types of features. Have a look at the
  |PluginMoveToThingAtCursor| plugin. *tovl-feature-set-extending*

  Also see |tovl-config-feature-sets|

==============================================================================
7.   TOVL library:					*tovl-library* {1

      ----------------------------------------------
      a small introduction to things you should know 
      ----------------------------------------------

TOVL TESTS						*tovl-tests* {{{2

    If you browse the library you'll see *_test.vim files. They contain
    some tests to ensure the library behaves as expected. Maybe there will
    be automatic test runners in the future.

TOVL TYPES						*tovl-type* {{{2

    I was faced by a problem (-> |tovl-function-references|). Therefore
    I had to extend the vim type system. (See |type()|)
    This is done by adding special keys to a dictionary to indicate it is not
    an arbitrary dictionary but a different type. see library#Type()

TOVL OBJECT OOP						*tovl-object* {{{2

    TOVL supports a basic OOP programming. See |tovl#obj#NewObject()|
    Basically this kind of duck typing (the way its done in Javascript).
    If something behaves like a duck it is one..
    You can also load missing features within an object at call time to
    keep startup time of vim as short as possible.
    Examples can be found in obj_test.vim.

TOVL LOGGING					*tovl-log* *tovl-logging* {{{2

    TOVL provides a minimal logging facility. The code has been optimized for
    speed (by keeping a list of log items which is cut only once in a while).
    Yet you can replace the code by your own if you have to.
    Use |tovl#log#Log()|to create log lines and use the command |TOVLLog|
    (plugin |PluginLog|) or >
      call plugins#tovl#log#ShowTOVLLog()
<   to view the log.
    To log every log level (error=0,info=1,debug=2) use
    *tovl-log-config*  >
      call tovl#log#GetLogger().SetLevel(999)
<   (You can also use the PluginTOVL_Config now)

    I recommend logging in your scripts this way: >
    fun! s:Log(level, msg)
      call tovl#log#Log("your_file",a:level, a:msg)
    endf

    try
      throw "test"
    catch /.*/
      call s:Log(2,"exception while testing"
       \ ." the exception and throwpoint will be ammended automatically")
    endtry
< 
    There is some a special treatment for exceptions: When the message begins
    with "exception" the Log function will automatically append v:exceptions
    and v:throwpoint.

TOVL CHOOSE					        *tovl-choose* {{{2

    One thing many scripts of need to do: Ask the user to pick an item from a
    list. a very simple function which can do this if you have 20 or less
    items is |tovl#ui#choice#LetUserSelectIfThereIsAChoice| which picks one
    item automatically if it's the only one.
    However I'd like to replace this by a TToC like implementation.

TOVL TRY					        *tovl-try* {{{2

    If you want test whether you should the one or the other setup then
    |library#Try| could be the function you'd like to use..

TOVL ERROR FORMATS		 	*tovl-error-formats* {{{2

    See |tovl#errorformat#SetErrorFormat(id)|
    and plugin autoload/plugins/tovl/errorformats.vim
    (I never want to have the quoting hell again :-)

TOVL RUN TASK MAYBE IN BACKGROUND		 *tovl-run-in-background* {{{2

    ! You must configure running tasks using the plugin
    autoload/plugins/tovl/runtaskinbackground.vim

    autoload/tovl/runtaskinbackground.vim provides methods to run external
    commands. The default is to run them in background. This requires
    has('client-server') because using |clientserver| [1] is the only way
    to notify vim about events (what process id and when the process has
    finished) asynchronously without increasing the probability crashing vim. >

    let process = tovl#runtaskinbackground#NewProcess(
      \ { 'name' : 'compilation', 'cmd': ["/bin/sh","-c",'sleep 10; echo done'],
        \ 'ef' : 'plugins#tovl#errorformats#PluginErrorFormats#php' })
    call process.Run()
<
    or as one line (for copy paste and testing) >
    call tovl#runtaskinbackground#NewProcess( { 'cmd': ["/bin/sh","-c",'sleep 3; echo done'], 'ef' : 'plugins#tovl#errorformats#PluginErrorFormats#php' }).Run()
 
<
    You can add the key 'fg' : 1 to force running in foreground only (TODO
    implement this)

    You must have enabled the |PluginErrorFormats| because the example is
    using 'ef'. If you haven't you'll get some error in the |tovl-log|

    You can set a different decorator to override the default OnStart and
    OnFinish events thereby making vim changing colors depending on process
    status etc. (Example: tovl#runtaskinbackground#DefaultDecorator() )

    There is also a very simple system() replacement:
    |tovl#runtaskinbackground#System()| It is used to run the shell background
    process. It checks the exit code for you automatically.

    Enjoy!

    [1] It seems that vim doesn't set the server name by default. That's why
    I'v put this into my .bashrc / .zshrc file: >
        vim(){ /usr/bin/vim --servername vim$(echo $RANDOM) "$@"; }
<

TOVL FUNCTION REFERENCES 		 *tovl-function-reference* {{{2

    vim already provides |function()| to create function references.
    It sucks because it assumes the function has already been loaded.
    That's bad because we'd like to make vim only load things which are
    actually used to keep vim fast.
    (Bram has sent a patch to the vim-dev mailinglist.. But I won't assume
    that you've applied that).
    
    So instead of call call(function('dir#MyFunc'),args,self) 
    use library#Call(library#Function('dir#MyFunc'),args,self)
    However both Function and Call are much more versatile because you can
    pass self by Function and you can also pass some first args of a function.
    You can also just write some small string lambdas or just use plain values: >
      " pass plain values
      3 == library#Call(3)

      " make the reference contain SELF and head of args
      let F = library#Function('return [ARGS[0], ARGS[1], SELF]',
            \ { args : [2], self : dict } )
      [2,"end",dict] == library#Call(F, ["end"])
<

    Using Call and Function is often very convinient because they let you
    write lazy code.

    Example: >
      fun! DoWithLines(lines)
        return library#Call(a:lines)[3]
      endf
      echo DoWithLines(readfile('foo'))
      " is the same as
      echo DoWithLines(library#Function('return readfile('.string('foo'))'))

      echo DoWithLines(library#Function(
        \ 'return GetFromHTTP('.string('http://www.vim.org'))'))
      " is the same as
      echo DoWithLines(library#Function(
        \ 'GetFromHTTP', {'args' : ['http://www.vim.org']})

      " This pays off if you consider this example only using the contents of
      " one template:
      InsertTemplate('template1', {
        \ 'template1' : readfile('foo'),
        \ 'template2' : readfile('foo2')
        \ })
>
TOVL ACTION		 				*tovl-action* {{{2

    IDE like features: Very often you work on project and you need some commands such
    as "compile target", "run target". Because there may be different ways to
    compile a project or to run the result a plugin providing those run or
    compile actions shouldn't map them directly. It should provide an
    feat_action feature. How does this work?

    Enable the plugin |PluginAction|. Make sure you've still enabled the
    |PluginExample|. Then refresh the TOVLConfig view. The |PluginExample|
    configuration section should now have: >
          feat_action:dictionary=
            print_hello_world_example_action:dictionary=
            [...]
<   Write the configuration. You should now have a mapping <s-F2> (<s-F3> ..).  and see
    something like this: >
    [0-9]* : select by index| <esc>: escape getchar() loop, any char: start filtering
       0)  example_hw  prints hello world after you've mapped this action to a key
<   Select the example_hw  action by pressing 0. You have mapped this action
    to F2 now for this vim session.

    You can assign these actions automatically by using  >
    MapActionKey <F2> example_hw
<   (TODO: make sure this works).. However be aware that some actions may want
    to start a small dialog..

TOVL ....

  TODO
  add  most useful stuff from the library written by Luc Hermitte
  add  most useful stuff from tlib. It already belongs to the repository.
  But it hasn't been merged yet.

==============================================================================
8.   Writing TOVL plugins ................................. *tovl-plugins*
  Have a look at the core/autoload/plugins/examples/example.vim
  file. (TODO)

  A TOVL plugin is a |tovl-object| having these methods at least:
    Load()      : this setups the plugin
    Unload()    : this unloads the plugin

    Map()       : adds a mapping [1]
    Au()        : adds an au command [2]

  less important:
    LoadPlugin(): internal, this calls Load
    Log(level, msg): |tovl-log|
    LogExec(level, prefix, cmd): Use this function to setup any user
                                interaction (such as commands) [3]
    OnConfigChange(): This is registered as config change notification handler
    AddDefaultConfigOptions(): This adds default options to the configuration
                               Consider using self['default']['key'] = value
                               instead.

  Both [1] and [2] are remembered. The plugin tries to remove those mappings
  on unload automatically. See core/autoload/tovl/plugin_management.vim.

  [3] users will be thankful because they can debug trouble more easily

  LoadPlugin() automatically gets a self.cfg dict from configuration.
  Hower this conflicts with |tovl-config-merge| . So please use
  config#Get(self.pluginName.'#mypath#opt') instead if you feel that someone
  would like to merge options here for now. (Maybe the implementation should
  be enhanced..) (TODO think about what is really needed)

  *tovl-plugin-loading-order*
  You can add the key "loadingOrder" of a plugin to make it load before or
  after other plugins.

  values used by library plugins:

     10 : used by  |tovl-config| plugin
     45 : used by  |tovl-feature-set-extending| plugins (map + command)
     50 : used by  |tovl-feature-set-extending| plugins requiring 45

    100 : default

    200 : PluginLocalVimrc

  its not perfect but is fastest and most simple.

==============================================================================
10.  TOVL FUNCTION REFERENCE (TODO)
      list of TOVL functions you should know about.

11.  Does tovl has some support for language or filetype X ? *tovl-lang-support*
  haskell: |lang_haskell.txt|

==============================================================================
20.  3rd party libraries, other code you should know about

  You've seen the autoload/tlib directory.
  I needed some functions of it and that's why I just copied them over.
  You can find the most current version of the tlib library here :
  http://github.com/tomtom/vimtlib.
  vimtlib has been written by Tom Link. It contains a lot of nice features.
  Eg the TToC command is smarter than the PluginTOVL_ToC in some aspects.

  (TODO extend this list)

==============================================================================
100. wish-list             *tovl-wish-list*

  * plugin dependencies. A depends on B and causes loading of B (thereby
    revealing its config options)
  * add completion stuff to the config editor
  * At least add a command jumping to the plugin source code or help document
  * ...

  You want to help? See |tovl-contribute|.
