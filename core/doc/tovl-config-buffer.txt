              Plugin configuration takes place here

==============================================================================
2.  Open the buffer 					{{{1

    You can edit any configuration file by :e tovl_config://<path>
    However using the *TOVLConfig* command is more convinient.
    It let's you choose the configuration file to edit from the list
    (|tovl-project-secific|)

==============================================================================
3.  Using the buffer
    The buffer contains a serialized dict representation.
    Example

        PluginGlobOpen:dictionary=
          exclude:list=
            string=v:val !~ '\.o$\|\.hi$\|\.svn$\|.git$\|_darcs$$\|.darcs$\|.hg'
            string=!isdirectory(v:val)
          multilineString=
            first line
            second line
            third line
    
    Right now I think the type= style is verbose. But it works and I don't
    want to spend more time on it.
    Simply write the file (:w) to save config and reload plugins.

==============================================================================
4.  tovl-main-config

  The head of the configuration file list (|tovl-project-specific|) is the
  *main-configuration-file* .
  That contains the list of availible plugins.

  You can find a small picture describing it here: 
  http://www.mawercer.de/~vim/tovl.png

  The file contains two sections (top level keys):
  a) loadablePlugins (contains the plugins you can enable)
    [...]
  b) plugins         (contains the plugin configuration options)
    [...]

  a) is only present in the |main-configuration-file| (head of configuration
  file list). The runtimepath/autoload/plugins/**/*.vim files are scanned for
  functions starting with Plugin. Those are added here.

  After writing the |main-configuration-file| the plugins will be asked to add
  their default configuration settings to b). You should review and customize
  them.

  If you change a configuration of a plugin it'll get notified.
  The default reaction is unload and load again. (This works more or less
  depending on plugin implementation)

  if you set the lhs or pattern of a mapping or au command to an empty string
  it will be disabled

  *tovl-config-special-keys* :
   You can add the following keys below each Plugin*:dictionary= line
      debugLoad:number=1 to any plugin configuration to start the vim debugger on Load()
      logAll:number=1 to add all levels of messages from this plugin. See |tovl-logging|
      mapleader (TODO)

  |tovl-logging| |tovl-config-special-keys|

==============================================================================
5.  Diffing options

  There is the command *DiffDefaults* which opens a new configuration file
  only adding defaults of the activated plugins. This way you can find changes
  and updates easily.. 

  You can make a backup of your configuration files by either backing up the
  file itself or by copy pasting the buffer contents somewhere else.

  In most cases undo is enough.

==============================================================================
6.  Plugin documentation

  Where can I find more information about a particular plugin?
  Q: How would like this information to be presented?
    for now have a look at the source code, please. TOVL is still work in
    progress. (-> |tovl-contribute|)
    By following the dictionary keys within all autoload directories
    (runtimepath) you'll find the right file
    (TODO: Create a mapping)

==============================================================================
24. Tutorial *tovl-config-tutorial*

    Installation: setup runtimepath (See |tovl-update|)

    Open the configuration file :TOVLConfig

    Start by enabling the example plugin "PluginExample".
    You do this by replacing the number=0 by number=1

    Write the buffer (:w). This should load the plugin.

    Refresh the buffer (:e! %)

    You'll notice that a plugins:dictionary= section has appeared.
    Customize the settings lhs and string but keep the rhs as is.
    Now write again (:w) You should now see the example plugin telling
    you that it has been loaded.

    Normally plugins are not that verbose. (See |tovl-logging|)

    Try the mapping (\hw) and the command (:Example)
    You should see "Hello!" beeing echoed.

    Each time you change the settings and write the buffer the plugin will get notified.
    It tries to reload itself. Play with the string setting.

    Now its time to try the (:DiffDefaults) command.
    It adds the default options of all enabled plugins to the buffer.
    You can find no longer used plugin configurations easily this way.
    
    If you remove the options (commandName and command) the plugin will readd
    them. Disabling commands is done by making the lhs empty.

    Where to go from here? Read the whole documentation
    |tovl-config-buffer.txt| and |tovl.txt|. Then tell me what you liked and
    what caused trouble (|tovl-contact|).
