*tovl-config-buffer.txt*	For Vim version 7.2.
==============================================================================

            ---------------------------------------
              Plugin configuration takes place here
            ---------------------------------------

==============================================================================
2.  Open the buffer 					{{{1

    You can edit any configuration file by :e tovl_config://<path>
    However using the *TOVLConfig* command is more convinient.
    It let's you choose the configuration file to edit from the list
    (|tovl-project-secific|)

==============================================================================
3.  Using the buffer
    The buffer contains a serialized dict representation.
    Example

        PluginGlobOpen:dictionary=
          exclude:list=
            string=v:val !~ '\.o$\|\.hi$\|\.svn$\|.git$\|_darcs$$\|.darcs$\|.hg'
            string=!isdirectory(v:val)
          multilineString=
            first line
            second line
            third line
    
    Right now I think the type= style is verbose. But it works and I don't
    want to spend more time on it.
    Simply write the file (:w) to save config and reload plugins.

==============================================================================
4.  tovl-main-config

  The head of the configuration file list (|tovl-project-specific|) is the
  *main-configuration-file* .
  That contains the list of availible plugins.

  You can find a small picture describing it here: 
  http://www.mawercer.de/~vim/tovl.png

  The file contains two sections (top level keys):
  a) loadablePlugins (contains the plugins you can enable)
    [...]
  b) plugins         (contains the plugin configuration options)
    [...]

  a) is only present in the |main-configuration-file| (head of configuration
  file list). The runtimepath/autoload/plugins/**/*.vim files are scanned for
  functions starting with Plugin. Those are added here.

  After writing the |main-configuration-file| the plugins will be asked to add
  their default configuration settings to b). You should review and customize
  them.

  If you change a configuration of a plugin it'll get notified.
  The default reaction is unload and load again. (This works more or less
  depending on plugin implementation)

  *tovl-config-special-keys* :
   You can add the following keys below each Plugin*:dictionary= line
      debugLoad:number=1 to any plugin configuration to start the vim debugger on Load()
      logAll:number=1 to add all levels of messages from this plugin. See |tovl-logging|
      mapleader (TODO)

  |tovl-logging| |tovl-config-special-keys|

==============================================================================
5.  Diffing options

    edit configuration file '.a:opts['name']
    Start by enabling the example plugin by setting the number to 1
    Then write the buffer. This should load the plugin and add default
    configuration options (commandName and command).
    each time you change the settings and write them the plugin will get notified
    about those changes and will reload itself. Try running the command ExamplePluginHW
    and watch it changing..
    
    If you remove the options (commandName and command) the plugin will add them
    for you again. This behaviour is plugin dependand.
    
    Maybe you want to have a look at core/autoload/example.vim now?
    Also make sure you've read the head comments in core/autoload/config.vim
    It tells you how to use multiple (project specific) configuration files.
    
    If you have any questions, don't know where to start or how to add your code
    write an email to marco-oweber@gmx.de (I'm also on irc.freenode.net, nick MarcWeber)
    
    use :messages to see which plugins has been loaded
    use :DiffDefaults to see how your configuration differs from the proposed one
    
    You can add the following keys to any plugins:
    
    If you set lhs or pattern to an empty string no au/ mapping will be added
    
    You can add mapleader:string=\ to set a different mapleader for this plugin only
