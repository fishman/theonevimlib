everything but theonevimlib.vim and this README file will be deleted
(by my personally when seeing that someone addsd a file to this git repostiory
directory without good reason)

Why? The user of theonevimlib must be sure that only code of plugins gets executed he trusts.
So the way to enable tovl plugins is not by putting them in here but by modifying the TOVLConfig.

Please setup your features using a plugin load function (see autoload/plugins/example.vim)
